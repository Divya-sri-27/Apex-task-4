Structure:
- index.html      (Portfolio / Home)
- todo.html       (To-Do app)
- products.html   (Products listing)
- assets/css/style.css
- assets/js/*.js
- assets/images/* (svg placeholders)
- assets/Divya_Sri_Resume.pdf (placeholder)

How to run:
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open index.html in your browser to view the portfolio. Use navigation to access To-Do and Products pages.

Notes:
- All code is static and client-side only. Contact form saves messages to localStorage as a fallback.
- Replace the resume placeholder with your real PDF for download.
